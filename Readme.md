# 🏦 High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Engine
- This project is a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) engine designed to simulate and execute algorithmic trades at ultra-fast speeds. It leverages Rust’s performance and safety features to build a robust, concurrent trading system.

## 🚀 What is HFT?
- High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a form of algorithmic trading that uses advanced hardware, software, and mathematical models to execute a large number of trades in fractions of a second.
## 🔑 Key Features
- ⚡ Speed: Executes trades in microseconds using asynchronous processing and efficient system design.
- 📊 Algorithms: All trading decisions are fully automated with no human intervention, using customizable mathematical models.
- 📈 High Volume: Capable of executing thousands to millions of trades daily.
- ⏱ Short Holding Time: Assets are typically held for milliseconds to a few seconds.
- 📡 Market Access: Designed with low-latency architecture, mimicking co-location strategies for faster access to market data.

## 🎯 Why HFT?
- To profit from arbitrage opportunities — small price differences across markets.
- To provide liquidity — by buying when others sell and vice versa.
- To react instantly to market events and news.

## VERSION 2 IMPROVEMENT 
- Database Operations:
    - Async writes to database in background
    - Batch operations instead of per-trade updates
- Matching Algorithm:
    - Maintain an in-memory order book
    - Implemented price-time priority matching
    - Used efficient data structures (BTreeMap for price levels, VecDeque for orders)

- Result: 
    - Send trades to a background thread via a queue (like a pipe) immediately after matching.
    - Never wait for DB confirmation.
    - 24hr Data Clone?
        - Yes: At midnight, take a snapshot of all active orders and save it.
        - Logs: Keep a separate log of all trades for auditing.

## 📦 Implemented Features

- ✅ Order matching engine using `OrderBook` (bid/ask management)
- ✅ Limit and Market order support
- ✅ Matching logic with quantity and price priority
- ✅ Real-time order placement via WebSocket
- ✅ Broadcasting responses to connected clients
- ✅ Background matching loop (runs every 100ms)
- ✅ Persistence via MySQL (or other SQLx-compatible DB)
- ✅ Modular architecture: services, payloads, handlers, repos

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Rust**
- **tokio** – async runtime
- **sqlx** – database access
- **dashmap** – concurrent order book
- **uuid** – unique client identification
- **tokio-tungstenite** – WebSocket handling
- **axum** – web framework (via Tower HTTP)
- **serde / serde_json** – JSON serialization
- **chrono** – timestamps


## 💡 Core Concepts
### 🔁 Matching Engine
- OrderBook holds bids and asks using DashMap<String, VecDeque<Order>>
    - Matching logic:
        - Match when highest bid ≥ lowest ask
        - Match quantity based on min(bid.qty, ask.qty)
        - Generate Trade object
        - or reduce matched orders

## 🧵 Matching Service
- Runs in a loop every 100ms
- Locks the shared OrderBook
- Calls .match_orders()
- Persists matched trades using TradeRepository

## 🌐 WebSocket Integration
- WebSocket server listens on port 9001
- On client connection:
    - Registers client
    - Listens for "create_order" events
- On "create_order":
    - Deserializes into CreateOrderPayload
    - Converts to internal Order model using TryFrom
    - Adds to order book
    - Responds with success or error


## 🛠️ Build & Run

1. Install dependencies
```
cargo build
```
2. Setup database
- Configure your .env with DB connection string
- Run DB migrations (if added)
3. Start the server
```
cargo run
```
