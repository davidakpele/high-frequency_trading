High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a type of algorithmic trading that uses powerful computers and complex mathematical models to execute a large number of orders at extremely high speeds—often in fractions of a second.
Key Features of HFT:
Speed: Trades happen in microseconds (millionths of a second) using advanced hardware and direct market access.
Algorithms: Decisions to buy/sell are made
automatically using mathematical models-no human intervention.
Volume: Executes thousands or millions of trades a day to exploit very small price differences.

Holding Time: HFT firms hold assets for very short durations-sometimes just milliseconds or seconds.
Market Access: Uses co-location (putting servers near exchanges) for faster data access.
Why HFT Exists:
9,885
To profit from small price differences across markets (arbitrage).
74
To provide liquidity (buying when others sell and vice versa).
4,269
To react faster than other traders to news or
market movements.

🎯 Ultimate Goal:
Build a high-speed, event-driven system that:

Receives buy/sell orders

Matches compatible orders

Executes trades instantly

Updates wallets/balances

Stores the data

Sends results back in real time

✅ Step-by-Step Breakdown
Here’s what we need to create first, and why:

1. order_book.rs
📂 Path: engine/order_book.rs

✅ Why?
This module maintains the in-memory list of active buy/sell orders for each trading pair. It allows:

Fast access to open orders

Sorted buy/sell queues

Efficient insert/delete/search

Example:

order_book.insert(order);    // Add new order  
order_book.match_order();    // Try matching


2. matcher.rs
📂 Path: engine/matcher.rs

✅ Why?
Contains the matching logic:

Compares new orders with existing ones in order_book

Finds matches by price/quantity

Returns a list of Trades to execute

This is your algorithmic engine.



3. trader.rs
📂 Path: engine/trader.rs

✅ Why?
Executes trades by:

Updating wallet balances

Locking/unlocking funds

Creating Trade records

This is your execution unit, simulating real exchange behavior.



4. order_service.rs
📂 Path: services/order_service.rs

✅ Why?
This layer handles the full order flow:

Validate order data

Insert into order_book

Call matcher

Call trader

Return results

Acts as the controller logic in business layer.


5. order_controller.rs
📂 Path: controllers/order_controller.rs

✅ Why?
This is the public entrypoint (WebSocket):

Accepts WS requests from Python clients

Sends to order_service

This is the API gateway for placing orders.


6. order_repository.rs
📂 Path: repositories/order_repository.rs

✅ Why?
Handles saving:

Orders (new or updated)

Trades (executed results)

Separates DB logic from core logic.
